## ✨ Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone project includes several core features that replicate the core functionalities of a short-term rental platform. Each feature is designed to provide a seamless experience for users, whether they are guests or hosts.

---

### 👥 User Management
Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. The system supports role-based access control, distinguishing between guests, hosts, and administrators.

---

### 🏡 Property Management
Hosts can list properties by providing essential information such as title, description, price, and location. They can also edit or delete listings and manage availability.

---

### 📅 Booking System
Guests can view property listings, select available dates, and make bookings. The system ensures that double bookings are avoided and booking history is recorded.

---

### 💳 Payment Integration
Secure payment processing is integrated for booking confirmation. Users can view payment status, and transactions are stored with booking details for future reference.

---

### ⭐ Reviews and Ratings
After their stay, guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties. This builds trust within the platform and helps future users make informed decisions.

---

### 🔎 Search and Filtering
Users can search for properties using filters like location, price range, property type, and availability. This enhances discoverability and improves the user experience.

---

### 🛠️ Admin Panel
Administrators have access to a dedicated dashboard to manage users, properties, bookings, and reported content. This ensures platform integrity and smooth operations.

---
## 🔒 API Security

Securing the backend APIs is a critical part of this project to ensure that user data, transactions, and platform integrity are protected. Below are the key security measures that have been or will be implemented:

---

### 🔐 Authentication
Only verified users can access protected endpoints using token-based or session-based authentication (e.g., JWT or Django sessions). This prevents unauthorized access and ensures that actions are tied to a known identity.

### 🛂 Authorization
Role-based access control is enforced to ensure that users can only perform actions they are permitted to—e.g., only hosts can manage their properties, and only guests can make bookings. This protects platform functionality and user data integrity.

### 🚫 Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse of the API through excessive requests or brute-force login attempts. This helps maintain API availability and reduces the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

### 🔑 Secure Password Storage
User passwords are hashed using strong algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 before storage. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, raw passwords are not exposed.

### 🧾 Input Validation & Sanitization
All input is validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other injection-based attacks. This ensures system stability and data integrity.

### 📦 Secure Data Transmission
All API traffic is encrypted using HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure secure communication between client and server.

### 💳 Payment Security
Payment-related endpoints are protected with an extra layer of validation and monitored for suspicious activity. This ensures that transactions remain safe and tamper-proof.

---

API security is crucial to protect sensitive user data, prevent fraud, and maintain trust in the platform. Every feature—whether user login, property management, or payment—requires strong security practices to ensure safe usage for all participants.
## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It is a development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code, making it faster and more reliable to release updates.

---

### 🔄 Why CI/CD is Important

- **Continuous Integration** ensures that new code pushed by developers is automatically tested and merged, reducing integration issues and improving code quality.
- **Continuous Deployment** automates the release of new features to staging or production environments, ensuring faster delivery and minimizing human error.
- This process helps maintain high code standards, reduces bugs in production, and allows for faster iteration and feedback loops.

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates tasks such as running tests, linting code, and deploying to servers directly from the GitHub repository.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments for testing and deployment by packaging the application and its dependencies into containers.
- **Heroku / Render / Railway** *(depending on what you're using)*: Platform-as-a-Service solutions that integrate easily with CI pipelines for automated deployments.
- **pytest / unittest** *(if using Python)*: Testing frameworks used to validate the functionality of the application before deployment.

---

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline improves the development workflow, ensures consistent quality, and enables faster, safer deployment of new features to users.
